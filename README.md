assignment will be due 3 days from when you first receive it. Please include all source files, unit

Problem: Iâ€™m reading a list of words and want to quickly know which words in the passage are
anagrams of each other. Given a list of words, print all anagrams occuring in the list as groups.

NOTES: A word is not an anagram of itself. Anagrams must use all the original letters exactly
once and must be only one word long. For example, Astronomers = Moon starers would not be
correct for this problem.
